# Tensor Flow Implementation - Neural Networks Training

## Introduction
- This week, we focus on training a neural network.
- Last week, we covered inference—how a neural network makes predictions.
- Now, we learn how to train a model using our own data.
- Analogy: Teaching a self-driving car to recognize stop signs—it needs to learn from thousands of images before making accurate identifications.

## Neural Network Architecture
- Example: **Handwritten digit recognition** (determining whether an image is a '0' or a '1').
- **Neural network structure:**
  - **Input Layer**: The image (`X`).
  - **Hidden Layers**:
    - First hidden layer: 25 units (neurons) with sigmoid activation.
    - Second hidden layer: 15 units.
  - **Output Layer**: 1 unit, which predicts if the digit is '0' or '1'.
- **Real-world analogy**: Similar to facial recognition in smartphones—layers analyze different features, from edges to complex shapes.

## Steps to Train a Neural Network in TensorFlow
### **Step 1: Define the Model**
- The model consists of a sequence of layers.
- **Code Example:**
```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(25, activation='sigmoid'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(15, activation='sigmoid'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```
- **Analogy**: Designing a new car—choosing the number of cylinders (neurons), the type of engine (activation function), and how many gears (layers) are needed.

### **Step 2: Compile the Model**
- Compiling sets up how the model will learn.
- **Key component: Loss function**, which measures how well the model is performing.
- **Code Example:**
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```
- **Loss Function (`binary_crossentropy`)**: Used for binary classification (like distinguishing between 0 and 1).
- **Optimizer (`adam`)**: Adjusts the model’s parameters to minimize the loss.
- **Analogy**: The loss function is like a GPS—it tells you how far off you are from your destination, and the optimizer is your ability to make course corrections.

### **Step 3: Train the Model**
- Training involves using the dataset (`X, Y`).
- **Code Example:**
```python
model.fit(X, Y, epochs=10)
```
- **Epochs**: Number of times the model goes through the entire dataset.
- More epochs help the model learn better, but too many can lead to overfitting.
- **Analogy**: Practicing a musical instrument—the more you practice (epochs), the better you get. But overdoing it without variation can make adapting to new pieces harder (overfitting).

## Why Understanding These Steps Matters
- Simply running these lines of code won’t make you an expert.
- Understanding the process helps when debugging performance issues.
- **Key concepts to grasp:**
  - Loss functions
  - Optimizers
  - Neural network layers
- **Analogy**: Debugging a faulty engine—knowing how each part (layers, loss, optimizer) interacts helps you identify and fix issues efficiently.
