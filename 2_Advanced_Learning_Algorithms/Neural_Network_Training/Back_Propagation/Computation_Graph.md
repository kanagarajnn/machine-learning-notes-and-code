# Understanding Computation Graphs and Backpropagation

## Overview
- **Computation graphs** are essential in deep learning, helping frameworks like **TensorFlow** compute derivatives automatically.
- They structure the computations needed to compute the **cost function (J)** step by step.
- Backpropagation uses computation graphs to efficiently calculate **gradients** for training neural networks.

---

## Computation Graph Example
- Consider a **simple neural network** with one layer and one output unit.
- The output is computed as:
  ```
  a = w * x + b
  ```
  - `x = -2` (input)
  - `w = 2` (weight)
  - `b = 8` (bias)
  - `y = 2` (actual target)
- The cost function (J) measures error:
  ```
  J = 1/2 * (a - y)^2
  ```

### **Step-by-Step Computation Graph**
1. Compute `c = w * x` → `c = -4`
2. Compute `a = c + b` → `a = 4`
3. Compute `d = a - y` → `d = 2`
4. Compute `J = 1/2 * d^2` → `J = 2`

**Key Insight**: Computation graphs break down complex functions into **smaller steps**, making it easier to compute **derivatives**.

## Backpropagation: Computing Derivatives
- **Backpropagation works in reverse (right-to-left)**, computing how changes in parameters affect `J`.
- It computes **partial derivatives** using the **chain rule**.

### **Step-by-Step Backpropagation**
1. **Compute `dJ/dJ` (trivial, equals 1)**.
2. **Compute `dJ/dD`**
   ```
   dJ/dD = D = 2
   ```
3. **Compute `dJ/dA` using `dJ/dD`**
   ```
   dJ/dA = dJ/dD * dD/dA = 2 * 1 = 2
   ```
4. **Compute `dJ/dC` using `dJ/dA`**
   ```
   dJ/dC = dJ/dA * dA/dC = 2 * 1 = 2
   ```
5. **Compute `dJ/dB` using `dJ/dA`**
   ```
   dJ/dB = dJ/dA * dA/dB = 2 * 1 = 2
   ```
6. **Compute `dJ/dW` using `dJ/dC` and `dC/dW`**
   ```
   dJ/dW = dJ/dC * dC/dW = 2 * (-2) = -4
   ```

**Key Takeaway**: The gradient of `J` with respect to `w` is `-4`, meaning increasing `w` increases `J` negatively.

## Why is Backpropagation Efficient?
- **Left-to-right computation (forward pass)** computes outputs step by step.
- **Right-to-left computation (backward pass)** reuses computations to efficiently compute derivatives.
- If a graph has `n` nodes and `p` parameters, backprop computes gradients in **O(n + p) steps**, instead of **O(n × p) steps**.

**Example:**
- If a neural network has **10,000 nodes** and **100,000 parameters**, backprop computes derivatives in **110,000 steps** instead of **1,000,000,000 steps**.
