# Matrix Multiplication Code: Vectorization in Neural Networks

## **Introduction**
Neural networks power many AI applications today, from **image recognition** to **natural language processing**. Efficient computation is essential to training and running deep learning models. Instead of performing operations one at a time, we use **vectorization**, allowing us to process entire sets of numbers simultaneously using **matrix multiplications**. This drastically improves the speed and efficiency of deep learning models.

In this document, we’ll explore **vectorized forward propagation**, demonstrating how modern neural networks optimize computation for scalability.

## **1. Why Vectorization Matters**
### **Computational Efficiency**
Consider making a cup of coffee:
- **Sequential Processing**: Manually grinding beans, boiling water, and brewing one cup at a time.
- **Vectorized Processing**: Using an **espresso machine** to brew multiple cups simultaneously.

Similarly, neural networks can be implemented either using **loops** (slow) or **matrix operations** (fast). Vectorization enables deep learning frameworks like **TensorFlow and PyTorch** to fully utilize **GPUs and optimized CPU instructions**, making large-scale models feasible.

### **Matrix Multiplication in Neural Networks**
Neural networks compute activations by multiplying **input matrices** with **weight matrices** and applying activation functions. This replaces inefficient **for-loop-based operations** with a single matrix equation:

```python
Z = np.matmul(A.T, W) + B
A_out = sigmoid(Z)
```
This efficiently computes the activations for multiple neurons at once.

## **2. Vectorized Forward Propagation Explained**
### **Breaking Down the Steps**
1. **Inputs (`A_in`)**: Input features arranged as a matrix.
2. **Weights (`W`)**: Model parameters stored in matrix form.
3. **Bias (`B`)**: A small adjustment factor added to each neuron’s computation.
4. **Activation Function (`g`)**: Applied element-wise to introduce non-linearity.

The entire **forward propagation** process can be expressed as:
```python
Z = np.matmul(A.T, W) + B
A_out = sigmoid(Z)
```
Where:
- `A.T` = **Transposed input matrix** (rows become columns for alignment).
- `W` = **Weight matrix**.
- `B` = **Bias matrix**.
- `Z` = **Weighted sum of inputs**.
- `A_out` = **Activated output (after applying sigmoid function)**.

### **Example: Forward Propagation in Python**
Consider a simple neural network with:
- **Input:** Temperature = `200°C`, Roasting Time = `17 min`
- **Weights (`W`)**: Three neurons, each with different weight parameters.
- **Bias (`B`)**: One bias term per neuron.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

# Input features (1×2 matrix)
A_in = np.array([[200, 17]])

# Weights (2×3 matrix)
W = np.array([
    [0.5, -0.3, 0.8],
    [0.2, -0.7, 1.5]
])

# Bias (1×3 matrix)
B = np.array([[2, -1, 3]])

# Forward propagation
Z = np.matmul(A_in, W) + B
A_out = sigmoid(Z)

print(A_out)
```
### **Output**
```
[[1. 0. 1.]]
```
Here:
- **Neuron 1**: Outputs **1** (sigmoid of large positive number).
- **Neuron 2**: Outputs **0** (sigmoid of large negative number).
- **Neuron 3**: Outputs **1** (sigmoid of another large positive number).

## **3. Why This Works Faster**
### **Without Vectorization (Loop-Based Approach)**
```python
A_out = []
for i in range(len(W)):
    Z = np.dot(A_in, W[i]) + B[i]
    A_out.append(sigmoid(Z))
```
- **Inefficient**: Iterates through each weight and bias manually.
- **Memory Overhead**: Stores intermediate results for each iteration.
- **Slow on large models**.

### **With Vectorization**
```python
Z = np.matmul(A_in, W) + B
A_out = sigmoid(Z)
```
- **One-step computation** using NumPy.
- **Highly optimized for GPUs and CPUs.**
- **Scalable for large datasets.**
