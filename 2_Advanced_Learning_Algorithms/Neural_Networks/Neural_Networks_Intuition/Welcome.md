## Course Overview

### **1. Understanding Neural Networks (Week 1)**
- **What are Neural Networks?**
  - Inspired by the human brain, neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data and learn patterns.
  - Example: Facial recognition in smartphones like **Apple Face ID** relies on deep neural networks to recognize faces.

- **Inference (Making Predictions)**
  - If you download a trained neural network model and use it for predictions, this process is called **inference**.
  - Example: When you ask **Google Translate** to translate a sentence, it applies inference using a trained neural network.

### **2. Training Your Own Neural Network (Week 2)**
- **How do we train neural networks?**
  - Given labeled examples (X as input, Y as output), the network adjusts its internal parameters to learn patterns.
  - This process requires **optimization techniques** like **gradient descent**.
  - Example: **Spotify’s recommendation engine** trains on user data (listening habits) to suggest new songs.

- **Key Question:** Should you invest in collecting more data or upgrade your **GPU** for faster training? This decision depends on your model's complexity and dataset quality.

### **3. Practical Machine Learning Advice (Week 3)**
- **Avoid Wasting Time on Ineffective Approaches**
  - Many ML engineers spend months on the wrong path due to lack of structured decision-making.
  - Example: A company training an AI assistant (like **Amazon Alexa**) might realize too late that a **bigger model** was not the solution—they actually needed **higher-quality data**.

- **Tips for Efficient ML Development**
  - Understand when to **improve model architecture** vs. **increase data quality**.
  - Measure model performance iteratively instead of waiting for months before evaluation.
  - Example: **Tesla’s self-driving AI** undergoes continuous learning with real-world driving data to enhance accuracy.

### **4. Decision Trees & Their Applications (Week 4)**
- **What are Decision Trees?**
  - Unlike neural networks, **decision trees** follow an interpretable **flowchart-like** structure to make decisions.
  - They split data into different branches based on feature values (e.g., "Is the income > $50K?").

- **Why Decision Trees?**
  - **Easy to interpret**: Unlike deep learning, decision trees clearly show how decisions are made.
  - **Widely used in industry**: Often preferred for structured data problems.
  - Example: **Credit scoring models** in banks use decision trees to decide whether to approve a loan.

- **Ensemble Methods (Boosting & Bagging)**
  - Combining multiple decision trees leads to **powerful models** like **Random Forests and XGBoost**.
  - Example: **Netflix’s recommendation system** employs ensemble learning to improve content suggestions.
