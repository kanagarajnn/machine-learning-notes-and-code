# Unsupervised Learning Part 2

## 1. Definition of Unsupervised Learning
- In **unsupervised learning**, the data includes only inputs (**x**) and no labeled outputs (**y**).
- The goal is to find patterns, structures, or other meaningful insights within the data without explicit labels.

## 2. Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
- **Clustering**: Groups similar data points together.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual events, useful for applications such as fraud detection in financial systems.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Compresses large datasets into smaller ones while retaining as much information as possible.

## 3. Applications of Clustering
- **Google News**: Uses clustering to group news articles based on shared topics.
- **Market Segmentation**: Automatically discovers customer segments for targeted marketing.

## 4. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Examples
- **Spam Filtering**: Supervised learning, as labeled data (spam vs. non-spam) is used.
- **News Grouping (Google News)**: Unsupervised learning, as clustering algorithms group similar articles.
- **Market Segmentation**: Unsupervised learning, identifying customer groups based on behavior.
- **Diagnosing Diabetes**: Supervised learning, as labeled data (diabetes vs. non-diabetes) is available.

## 5. Upcoming Topics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Learn how to identify outliers and detect irregularities in datasets.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Explore techniques to simplify large datasets while minimizing information loss.

## 6. Practical Insights
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks effectively for implementing machine learning algorithms.

## 7. Summary of Key Concepts
- Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques, with clustering being one of the most prominent.
- Additional methods such as anomaly detection and dimensionality reduction will be explored in later sections of this specialization.
