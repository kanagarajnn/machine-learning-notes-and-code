# Unsupervised Machine Learning Part 2

## Definition of Unsupervised Learning
- In **unsupervised learning**, data consists only of inputs (**X**) without predefined labels (**Y**).
- The goal is to uncover **hidden patterns, structures, or relationships** in data without explicit guidance.
- **Real-World Example**: Online retailers like **Amazon** use unsupervised learning to segment customers into groups based on shopping behavior.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
- **Clustering**: Groups similar data points together based on shared characteristics.
  - **Example**: **Google News** groups news articles related to the same topic.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual or unexpected data points, useful for detecting fraud or network intrusions.
  - **Example**: **PayPal and Mastercard** use anomaly detection to flag fraudulent transactions.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces large datasets while preserving essential information, making data analysis more efficient.
  - **Example**: Used in **medical imaging** to compress high-dimensional data while retaining critical diagnostic features.

## Applications of Clustering
- **Google News**: Uses clustering algorithms to automatically group news articles based on shared topics and trends.
- **Market Segmentation**: Businesses like **Spotify and Netflix** analyze user behavior to group customers into segments for personalized recommendations.
- **Healthcare**: Hospitals use clustering to classify patients into risk groups based on medical history and genetic data.
- **Cybersecurity**: Organizations like **IBM and Palo Alto Networks** use clustering to detect patterns in cyber threats and anomalies in network traffic.

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Examples
- **Spam Filtering**: **Supervised Learning** - Labeled data (spam vs. non-spam) is used for training.
- **News Grouping (Google News)**: **Unsupervised Learning** - Articles are automatically grouped without predefined labels.
- **Market Segmentation (Amazon, Shopify)**: **Unsupervised Learning** - Customer groups are identified based on behavioral similarities.
- **Medical Diagnosis (Diabetes Detection)**: **Supervised Learning** - Doctors use historical labeled data (diabetes vs. non-diabetes) to train models.

## Practical Insights
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Gain hands-on experience using Jupyter Notebooks to implement unsupervised learning algorithms in real-world projects.
- **Real-World Use Case**: How self-driving cars from **Tesla** use unsupervised learning to adapt to changing road conditions.

## Summary of Key Concepts
- Unsupervised learning encompasses various techniques, with **clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction** being the most common.
- These techniques are widely used across industries such as **finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and personalized recommendations**.
