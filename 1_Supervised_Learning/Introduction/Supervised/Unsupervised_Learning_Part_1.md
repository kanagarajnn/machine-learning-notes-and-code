# Unsupervised Machine Learning Part 1

## Definition of Unsupervised Learning
- Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with **unlabeled data**, meaning there are no predefined output labels.
- The algorithm identifies **patterns, structures, or clusters** within the data without explicit guidance.
- **Real-World Example**: Netflix uses unsupervised learning to **segment users** based on their viewing habits, helping provide personalized recommendations.

## Clustering Algorithms
- **Clustering** is a common unsupervised learning approach used to group similar data points into clusters.
- **Example**: Assigning patients into clusters based on tumor size and age without specifying whether tumors are benign or malignant.
- **Real-World Application**: Banks like **JPMorgan Chase** use clustering to group customers by spending behavior for targeted financial products.

## Application: Google News
- **Google News** uses clustering algorithms to group related news articles by identifying patterns in word usage.
- **Example**: Articles containing similar terms like "panda," "twins," and "zoo" are grouped into the same cluster.
- The algorithm self-discovers clusters without being explicitly programmed to look for specific terms.
- **Industry Relevance**: News aggregators like **Apple News and Flipboard** use similar clustering techniques to personalize content feeds.

## Application: Genetic Data Analysis
- Clustering is used to analyze **DNA microarray data** by grouping individuals based on gene expression.
- Columns represent individuals, and rows represent genes (e.g., genes affecting eye color or height).
- The algorithm identifies distinct groups (e.g., type 1, type 2, type 3) without prior knowledge of the characteristics.
- **Real-World Use**: Companies like **23andMe and AncestryDNA** use clustering to find genetic similarities among individuals.

## Application: Market Segmentation
- Clustering can group customers into different **segments** based on their behavior and preferences.
- **Example**: DeepLearning.AI segmented learners into groups such as:
  - Those seeking knowledge to grow skills.
  - Those aiming for career development.
  - Those staying updated on AIâ€™s impact in their field.
- **Industry Relevance**: E-commerce platforms like **Amazon and Shopify** use clustering to offer personalized shopping experiences.

## Advantages of Clustering
- Automatically discovers **patterns and structures** in data.
- Useful for organizing **unstructured data** and making **data-driven decisions**.
- **Business Application**: Retail companies like **Walmart and Target** use clustering to optimize store layouts based on customer purchasing behavior.

## Broader Scope of Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering is **one type** of unsupervised learning.
- Future lessons will explore **other unsupervised learning algorithms**, such as **anomaly detection** and **dimensionality reduction**.
- **Real-World Impact**: Anomaly detection is widely used in **cybersecurity** to detect fraudulent transactions at **Visa and Mastercard**.

## Real-World Relevance
- Applications include **organizing large datasets**, **improving personalized recommendations**, and **discovering insights in complex data**.
- **Example**: **Spotify and Apple Music** use unsupervised learning to **cluster users based on music preferences** and create dynamic playlists.

## Next Steps in Learning
- The next lesson will dive into **other types of unsupervised learning algorithms** and their **real-world use cases**.
- **Upcoming Case Study**: Using unsupervised learning in **healthcare** for **early disease detection** through medical imaging data.
