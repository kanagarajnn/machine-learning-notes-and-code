# Supervised Machine Learning Part 1

## Economic Impact of Machine Learning
- **Supervised learning** is responsible for **99% of economic value** generated by machine learning today.
- It is widely used in industries such as **finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and autonomous systems**.
- **Example**: **JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs** use supervised learning for fraud detection and risk assessment.

## Definition of Supervised Learning
- Supervised learning algorithms learn from **input-output pairs**, using historical data to make predictions.
- The model predicts an output given a new input based on previously labeled examples.
- **Example**: Netflix’s **recommendation system** predicts what a user might watch next based on past viewing behavior.

## Real-World Applications of Supervised Learning
- **Spam Filtering**: Platforms like **Gmail** use ML to filter spam emails.
- **Speech Recognition**: Virtual assistants such as **Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa** transcribe spoken words into text.
- **Machine Translation**: AI-driven translation services like **Google Translate and DeepL** convert text between languages.
- **Online Advertising**: Companies like **Google Ads and Facebook Ads** predict which ads a user is likely to click.
- **Self-Driving Cars**: Tesla’s **Autopilot** and Waymo’s self-driving technology use supervised learning to recognize pedestrians, lanes, and traffic signs.
- **Manufacturing**: AI-powered **computer vision systems** at **BMW and Tesla factories** detect defects in production lines.

    | **Input (X)**            | **Output (Y)**               | **Application**          |
    |--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
    | email                    | spam? (0/1)                  | spam filtering           |
    | audio                    | text transcripts             | speech recognition       |
    | English                  | Spanish                      | machine translation      |
    | ad, user info            | click? (0/1)                 | online advertising       |
    | image, radar info        | position of other cars       | self-driving car         |
    | image of phone           | defect? (0/1)                | visual inspection        |

## Training the Model
- Supervised learning requires a **dataset** containing **input X** and the corresponding **correct output Y**.
- The model is trained by adjusting parameters until it can predict **Y** accurately for unseen **X**.
- **Example**: An AI-based **loan approval system** at **Wells Fargo** is trained on historical lending data to predict the likelihood of loan repayment.

## Example: Predicting House Prices
- A model can predict house prices based on **square footage, number of bedrooms, and location**.
- **Example**: **Zillow’s Zestimate** uses machine learning to estimate real estate prices.
- A simple model might fit a **straight line**, while a more complex model could fit a **nonlinear curve**.
- The model systematically chooses the most appropriate function based on training data.

## Regression vs. Classification
- **Regression**: Predicts **continuous numerical values** (e.g., house prices, temperature forecasts, stock price predictions).
- **Classification**: Categorizes data into **distinct classes** (e.g., fraud detection, medical diagnoses, spam vs. non-spam emails).
- **Example**:
  - **Regression**: Predicting **stock prices** for **NASDAQ** based on market trends.
  - **Classification**: **Amazon’s product review system** classifying reviews as **positive or negative**.

## Importance of Choosing the Right Model
- The choice between a **simple model (e.g., linear regression)** and a **complex model (e.g., deep neural networks)** depends on:
  - **Dataset complexity** (number of features, size of data, variability).
  - **Prediction accuracy required** (e.g., predicting heart disease requires high accuracy).
  - **Computational cost** (deep learning requires more resources than traditional ML models).
- **Example**:
  - **Financial forecasting (Goldman Sachs)**: Uses deep learning due to large, complex financial data.
  - **Weather prediction (NOAA)**: Uses regression-based models due to high variability in atmospheric conditions.
