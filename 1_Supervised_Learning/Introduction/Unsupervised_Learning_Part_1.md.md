# Unsupervised Machine Learning Part 1

## 1. Definition of Unsupervised Learning
- Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with data that does not have output labels (e.g., no labels like benign or malignant).
- The algorithm identifies patterns, structures, or clusters within the data without explicit guidance.

## 2. Clustering Algorithms
- **Clustering** is a common unsupervised learning approach used to group similar data points into clusters.
- Example: Assigning patients into clusters based on tumor size and age without specifying whether tumors are benign or malignant.

## 3. Application: Google News
- Google News uses clustering algorithms to group related news articles by identifying patterns in word usage.
- Example: Articles containing similar terms like "panda," "twins," and "zoo" are grouped into the same cluster.
- The algorithm self-discovers clusters without being explicitly programmed to look for specific terms.

## 4. Application: Genetic Data Analysis
- Clustering is used to analyze DNA microarray data by grouping individuals based on gene expression.
- Columns represent individuals, and rows represent genes (e.g., genes affecting eye color or height).
- The algorithm identifies distinct groups (e.g., type 1, type 2, type 3) without prior knowledge of the characteristics.

## 5. Application: Market Segmentation
- Clustering can group customers into different segments based on their behavior and preferences.
- Example: DeepLearning.AI segmented learners into groups such as:
  - Those seeking knowledge to grow skills.
  - Those aiming for career development.
  - Those staying updated on AIâ€™s impact in their field.

## 6. Advantages of Clustering
- Automatically discovers patterns and structures in data.
- Useful for organizing unstructured data and making data-driven decisions.

## 7. Broader Scope of Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering is one type of unsupervised learning.
- Future lessons will explore other unsupervised learning algorithms beyond clustering.

## 8. Real-World Relevance
- Applications include organizing large datasets, improving personalized recommendations, and discovering new insights in complex data.

## 9. Next Steps in Learning
- The next lesson will dive into other types of unsupervised learning algorithms and their use cases.
