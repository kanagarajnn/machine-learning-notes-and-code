# Jupyter Notebook Introduction

## Importance of Jupyter Notebooks
- Jupyter Notebook is one of the **most widely used tools** in **machine learning, data science, and AI research**.
- It is an interactive environment for writing and executing **Python code**, making it essential for prototyping ML models.
- **Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook** use Jupyter Notebooks for research, development, and education.
- **Google Colab** provides a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment, allowing users to run ML code without local setup.

## Learning and Practicing in Jupyter Notebooks
- The course provides hands-on experience using **Jupyter Notebooks** directly in the web browser.
- Learners will interact with **pre-built code** and later implement their own models and algorithms.
- **Real-World Example**: Data scientists at **Netflix and Spotify** use Jupyter Notebooks to analyze user data and develop recommendation systems.

## Optional Labs
- **Designed to be beginner-friendly and practical**.
- These labs contain **pre-written code snippets**, requiring minimal manual coding.
- Running the code helps learners understand how machine learning algorithms work.
- Completing them is **optional** but recommended for gaining hands-on experience.

## Practice Labs
- Unlike optional labs, **practice labs require learners to write actual code**.
- These labs provide an opportunity to build machine learning models from scratch.
- **Real-World Application**: Engineers at **Tesla and OpenAI** use Jupyter Notebooks to fine-tune deep learning models for self-driving cars and AI research.

## Introduction to Jupyter Notebook Cells
- A **notebook consists of multiple blocks (cells)** that contain either:
  - **Markdown Cells**: Used for documentation and explanations.
  - **Code Cells**: Contain Python code that can be executed directly.
- **Running a cell**: Pressing **Shift + Enter** executes the code or formats the text.
- **Real-World Use Case**: Jupyter Notebooks are used in **Kaggle competitions** for data science and ML model development.

## Interacting with Code in Jupyter Notebooks
- Learners should:
  - Read through the provided code.
  - Predict the output before running the code.
  - Execute the code using **Shift + Enter**.
  - Modify the code and observe changes in output.
- **Example**: Data scientists at **Google AI** use Jupyter Notebooks to experiment with deep learning models before deploying them at scale.

## Encouragement to Explore Python in Jupyter Notebooks
- Experimenting with Python in Jupyter Notebooks is crucial for mastering machine learning.
- Learners are encouraged to **test different ML models, play with datasets, and visualize data**.
- **Real-World Application**: AI researchers at **DeepMind** use Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing reinforcement learning experiments.

## Next Steps
- The next lesson will **introduce the first supervised learning algorithm**.
- Learners will begin working on actual supervised learning models in Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Upcoming Real-World Project**: Building a **linear regression model for predicting housing prices** using Jupyter Notebooks.
