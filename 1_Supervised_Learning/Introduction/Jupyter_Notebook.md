# Jupyter Notebook Introduction

## 1. Importance of Jupyter Notebooks
- Jupyter Notebook is the **most widely used tool** for machine learning and data science practitioners.
- It is used for **coding, experimenting, and testing machine learning concepts**.
- The same tool is used by developers in leading tech companies worldwide.

## 2. Learning and Practicing in Jupyter Notebooks
- The course provides hands-on experience using **Jupyter Notebooks** directly in the web browser.
- Learners will interact with **pre-built code** and later implement their own code.

## 3. Optional Labs
- **Designed to be easy and beginner-friendly.**
- These labs contain **pre-written code**, requiring no manual coding input.
- Running the code helps learners understand how machine learning algorithms work.
- Completing them is **optional** but recommended for gaining practical insights.

## 4. Practice Labs
- Unlike optional labs, **practice labs require writing actual code**.
- These labs provide an opportunity to build machine learning models from scratch.
- More details on practice labs will be provided in the coming weeks.

## 5. Introduction to Jupyter Notebook Cells
- A **notebook consists of multiple blocks (cells)** that contain either:
  - **Markdown Cells**: Text descriptions of the code.
  - **Code Cells**: Actual Python code that can be executed.
- **Running a cell**: Pressing **Shift + Enter** executes the code or formats the text.

## 6. Interacting with Code in Jupyter Notebooks
- Learners should:
  - Read through the provided code.
  - Predict the output before running the code.
  - Execute the code using **Shift + Enter**.
  - Modify the code and observe the effects.

## 7. Encouragement to Explore Python in Jupyter Notebooks
- Experimenting with Python in Jupyter Notebooks is key to mastering machine learning.
- The instructor encourages learners to **play around with different code snippets**.
- Spending time in Jupyter Notebooks enhances familiarity with Python programming.

## 8. Next Steps
- The next lesson will **introduce the first supervised learning algorithm**.
- Learners will begin working on actual supervised learning models in Jupyter Notebooks.
